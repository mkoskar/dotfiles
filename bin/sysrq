Command     Function
=========== ===================================================================

  b         Will immediately reboot the system without syncing or unmounting
            your disks.

  c         Will perform a system crash by a NULL pointer dereference.
            A crashdump will be taken if configured.

  d         Shows all locks that are held.

  e         Send a SIGTERM to all processes, except for init.

  f         Will call the oom killer to kill a memory hog process, but do not
            panic if nothing can be killed.

  g         Used by kgdb (kernel debugger)

  h         Will display help (actually any other key than those listed
            here will display help. but h is easy to remember :-)

  i         Send a SIGKILL to all processes, except for init.

  j         Forcibly "Just thaw it" - filesystems frozen by the FIFREEZE ioctl.

  k         Secure Access Key (SAK) Kills all programs on the current virtual
            console. NOTE: See important comments below in SAK section.

  l         Shows a stack backtrace for all active CPUs.

  m         Will dump current memory info to your console.

  n         Used to make RT tasks nice-able

  o         Will shut your system off (if configured and supported).

  p         Will dump the current registers and flags to your console.

  q         Will dump per CPU lists of all armed hrtimers (but NOT regular
            timer_list timers) and detailed information about all
            clockevent devices.

  r         Turns off keyboard raw mode and sets it to XLATE.

  s         Will attempt to sync all mounted filesystems.

  t         Will dump a list of current tasks and their information to your
            console.

  u         Will attempt to remount all mounted filesystems read-only.

  v         Forcefully restores framebuffer console
  v         Causes ETM buffer dump [ARM-specific]

  w         Dumps tasks that are in uninterruptable (blocked) state.

  x         Used by xmon interface on ppc/powerpc platforms.
            Show global PMU Registers on sparc64.
            Dump all TLB entries on MIPS.

  y         Show global CPU Registers [SPARC-64 specific]

  z         Dump the ftrace buffer

  0-9       Sets the console log level, controlling which kernel messages
            will be printed to your console. (0, for example would make
            it so that only emergency messages like PANICs or OOPSes would
            make it to your console.)
